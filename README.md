# jekyll-vanilla-theme

Port of Vanilla framework to Jekyll theme.

## Usage

To run, do the following:

```bash
npm install
jekyll s --baseurl=''
Then visit http://127.0.0.1:4000/
```

This will install the vanilla framework locally but is ignored so `npm install`
will need to be run when deployed to production.


Enjoy!
